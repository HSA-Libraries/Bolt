* \page distributingBoltProjects Distributing Projects Built With Bolt
* \tableofcontents
* Bolt is a runtime library that also contains dependencies on other runtimes.  For instance, if the project is built
* with the OpenCL &tm; backend, Bolt contains a dependency on the OpenCL &tm; runtime.  If the project is built with the AMP
* backend, Bolt contains a dependency on the AMP runtime.  Likewise for a project that wishes Bolt to use TBB support.
* Each of these runtimes includes DLLs that must be found on the machine that is executing at runtime.  For each
* backend Bolt provides, instructions are provided to help Bolt users understand what the dependencies are and how to
* properly package an application to resolve all runtime dependencies.
*
* \section distribute_opencl OpenCL
* A Bolt application that is built with the OpenCL backend will have a runtime dependency on OpenCL.dll, which is the
* ICD library provided by the Khronos Group.  More information about the ICD file is available at
* <a href='http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/'>http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/</a>. When a Bolt application
* executes, the ICD is expected to be found on the users machine or else the Bolt application will fail to load and the
* OS will provide an exception message stating that the .DLL is missing. The ICD file is typically installed on user's
* computers through the AMD Catalyst<SUP>TM</SUP> software package; more information can found at
* <a href='http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-catalyst/pages/catalyst.aspx'>
* http://www.amd.com/us/products/technologies/amd-catalyst/pages/catalyst.aspx </a>.
*
* If the Bolt application can require that the AMD Catalyst software be installed on all user machines, no further action
* is necessary.  The OpenCL.dll will be pre-installed on user's machines.  However, if this guarantee cannot be made,
* then it must be the responsibility for the Bolt application to bundle the OpenCL.dll into the Bolt package.  This is
* required even if Bolt is only expected to run on CPU cores, because Bolt needs OpenCL.dll to query the platform to
* determine if any heterogeneous cores are available. TBB support is discussed in the \ref distribute_tbb section of
* this document.
*
* \section distribute_amp AMP
* A Bolt application that is built with the AMP backend will have a runtime dependency on vcamp110.dll, which is
* runtime component of Microsoft's C++AMP runtime.  Further information can be found in this blog entry
* http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nativeconcurrency/archive/2012/03/12/deploying-apps-built-with-c-amp.aspx.
* The recommended solution from the blog is to install the  Visual Studio redistributable package on the target
* machine.
* As no current operations systems by Microsoft deploys with this file pre-installed at this time, if the Bolt application can
* require that Visual Studio 2012 be present on the users machine, then no further action is necessary.  However, if
* this guarantee cannot be made, then it must be the responsibility for the Bolt applications installer to either
* install the correct Visual Studio redistributable or do prompt the user to do so. Failure to do so will cause the
* Bolt application to fail to load and the OS will provide an exception message stating that the .DLL is missing.
*
* \section distribute_tbb TBB
* TBB can optionally be built into Bolt, such that the Bolt application can split the work across the homogeneous CPU
* cores. If Bolt is built with the optional TBB, a runtime dependency is created with TBB.dll or TBB_debug.dll,
* depending on the build configuration. TBB cannot in general be expected to be on any user's machine, so it must be
* the responsibility for the Bolt application to bundle the TBB dependencies into the Bolt package. TBB is provided as
* both open source or with a commercial license attached.  More information about TBB can be found at
* <a href='http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/'> http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/ </a>
