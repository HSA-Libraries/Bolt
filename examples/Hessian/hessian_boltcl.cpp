// Bolt-for-OCL has restriction that we can't include pointers in the functors - the functor is initialized on the host and read on the device, and OpenCL doesn't provide a mechanism to make this work:
//   * 6.9 p)   Structures cannot contain OpenCL objects (buffers, images).
//   * Host and device pointers are not guaranteed to be the same - the handoff is handled through the cl::buffer object.  When the runtime launches the kernel, it provides an address in GPU-space to the kernel.
//   * The solution is SVM, where host and device have same pointer.  Then we can create a structure with a pointer; host can determine that pointer and write it to the structure; then host can directly use the pointer.
